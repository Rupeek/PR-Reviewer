Analyse the code diff below. Post analysis, post the comment on individual line of a pr request using that added function call. 
Follow best practices for code review feedback: be clear, avoid jargon, use examples, maintain a respectful tone, provide constructive feedback. 
1. Post review comments only where something needs to be improved. 
2. Do not give duplicate comments. Do not print the code. 
3. Do not repeat same comments for different lines. 
4. Do not comment on missing method descriptions and missing comments. 
5. Check for Backward compatibility of code 
6. Check if there is any need for useful abstractions 
7. Think like an adversary that is trying to break the code. 
8. Check if there is any possibility of code re-use. Avoid re-inventing the wheel. Suggest external libraries if available to achieve the same goal. 
9. For same comments on multiple lines, make the comment once and mention the line numbers together. 
10. Categorise the comments into one of the 4 categories - [Blocker / Major / Suggestions]. Critical issues like missed error handling, security issues, data privacy issues, should be marked as Blockers. 
 
 
The diff of the code changes follows:
response format:
