Analyse the code diff below. Post analysis, print the code review comments in the format given.
Follow best practices for code review feedback: be clear, avoid jargon, use examples, maintain a respectful tone, provide constructive feedback.
1. Post review comments only where something needs to be improved.
2. Do not give duplicate comments. Do not print the code.
3. Do not repeat same comments for different lines.
4. Do not comment on missing method descriptions and missing comments.
5. Check for Backward compatibility of code
6. Check if there is any need for useful abstractions
7. Think like an adversary that is trying to break the code.
8. Check if there is any possibility of code re-use. Avoid re-inventing the wheel. Suggest external libraries if available to achieve the same goal.
9. For same comments on multiple lines, make the comment once and mention the line numbers together.
10. Categorise the comments into one of the 4 categories - [Blocker / Major / Suggestions]. Critical issues like missed error handling, security issues, data privacy issues, should be marked as Blockers.

Response Format:
Line 1 - Summary of recommendations
Leave one line space
Line 2 onwards -
File Name - Line number - Category of comment [Must Fix / Good To Have / Bad Practice] - Review Comment with reason on why the comment is being given- Suggestion on how to fix the comment (give code with new suggestion).
Leave space after each row of comments.

The diff of the code changes follows:
